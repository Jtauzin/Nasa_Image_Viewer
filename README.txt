Hello and welcome to the Nasa Image Viewer application written in Kotlin!

This was a coding challenge, and submission is going through github. That being said, this was super
fun to work on and I plan to keep this repository open. There is a lot of good information in it,
specifically this repo contains code on generating images from an API (in this case the NASA API) in
line with accompanying information such as title, author, and date. As well as countering some
quirks that may be encountered on recycler view.

I chose to do this in Kotlin since it is a newer language to me. I figured this would be good
practice!

Guideline notes below:

• All functionality is in the main activity as guidelines mention.

• Recycler view is used is requested.

• Each image is contained within its own ViewHolder with additional information describing
the image (a minimum of title, author, and date) is displayed.

• User may swipe down to refresh and cycle through from a series of queries.

• If anything is seen in the app that is deemed against best practices please reach
out! There is always room to grow :)

• As a bonus and just for kicks, a search feature was implemented. It can be accessed via the drop
down in the top right corner of the screen. The app just didn't feel right without a search.


With love,

James
